Static References:
- size 1 - LiteRef1
- size 9+ - LiteRef9
- multiple pools - LiteRefMultiPool

Dynamic References:

Static + Dynamic in same contract


Generated Tests:
- Codegen should generate a contract and a test contract for it
- Tests for codegen should run the generated test contract, or at least 2 steps with a script that does it

Should generate a base contract called ContractBase that a user extends to create theirs


Notes
- Static literef storage does not support starting at any offset but 0
- String64 is not yet supported in PDK
